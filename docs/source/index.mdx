The documentation is organized into 3 sections:
1. **GET STARTED** provides a quick tour of the library and installation instructions to get up and running.
2. **TUTORIALS** are a great place to start if you're a beginner! We also include sample applications for you to play around with!
3. **API REFERENCE** describes all classes and functions, as well as their available parameters and types.

## Supported tasks/models
